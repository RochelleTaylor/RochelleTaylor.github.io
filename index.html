                        <p>I was born in Marysville Ohio, Januray 24th. I lived in a small town called West-Liberty until the age of 13. My mother moved my brother and I to Columbus to better our education and give us more opportunites. After Highschool, I attended Columbus State to continue my education in healthcare. After a couple years I decided to transfer into tech and pursue my interest in Software Development. I am a dog mom of a Shiba Inu named Rosco who brings me so much joy. I enjoy cooking, reading,traveling, playing board games and listening to music. I am so excited where my life is headed and transforming into the tech industry. I cant wait to see what the future holds!</p>
